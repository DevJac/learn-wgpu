# Dependencies and the window

## Boring, I know
Some of you reading this are very experienced with opening up windows in Rust and probably have your favorite windowing library, but this guide is designed for everybody, so it's something that we need to cover. Luckily, you don't need to read this if you know what you're doing. One thing that you do need to know is that whatever windowing solution you use needs to support the [raw-window-handle](https://github.com/rust-windowing/raw-window-handle) crate.

## What crates are we using?
For the beginner stuff, we're going to keep things very simple, we'll add things as we go, but I've listed the relevant `Cargo.toml` bits below.

```toml
[dependencies]
image = "0.23"
winit = "0.22"
shaderc = "0.6"
cgmath = "0.17"
env_logger = "0.7"
log = "0.4"
wgpu = "0.6"
futures = "0.3"
```

### Vulkan Portability Layer

You may also want to make the Vulkan backend available on platforms where it is by default not, e.g. Mac OS. The reason
you might want to enable the Vulkan backend is if you are doing cross-platform development and you need the
Vulkan validation layers output. 

To enable the Vulkan backend, add this new section to `Cargo.toml`, and do not forget to remove `wgpu` from the earlier
`[dependencies]` section.

``` toml
[dependencies.wgpu]
version = "0.6"
features = ["vulkan-portability"]
```

- This may not be necessary because normally `wgpu-rs` validation will catch problems. In fact that is one of it's
  design goals.
- This is not intended for shipping code. 
- See also [gfx-portability](https://github.com/gfx-rs/portability).

## The code
There's not much going on here yet, so I'm just going to post the code in full. Just paste this into you're `main.rs` or equivalent.

```rust
use winit::{
    event::*,
    event_loop::{EventLoop, ControlFlow},
    window::{Window, WindowBuilder},
};

fn main() {
    env_logger::init();
    let event_loop = EventLoop::new();
    let window = WindowBuilder::new()
        .build(&event_loop)
        .unwrap();

    event_loop.run(move |event, _, control_flow| {
        match event {
            Event::WindowEvent {
                ref event,
                window_id,
            } if window_id == window.id() => match event {
                WindowEvent::CloseRequested => *control_flow = ControlFlow::Exit,
                WindowEvent::KeyboardInput {
                    input,
                    ..
                } => {
                    match input {
                        KeyboardInput {
                            state: ElementState::Pressed,
                            virtual_keycode: Some(VirtualKeyCode::Escape),
                            ..
                        } => *control_flow = ControlFlow::Exit,
                        _ => {}
                    }
                }
                _ => {}
            }
            _ => {}
        }
    });
}
```

All this does is create a window, and keep it open until until user closes it, or presses escape. Next tutorial we'll actually start using wgpu!
